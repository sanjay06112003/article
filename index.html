                Jallikattu, also known as Eru Thazhuvuthal or Manju Virattu, is a traditional bull-taming sport celebrated in Tamil Nadu, India, during the Pongal festival. This ancient event, which dates back over 2,500 years, is deeply rooted in Tamil culture and is seen as a symbol of valor and pride. During Jallikattu, a bull is released into a crowd of participants who try to grab the bull's hump and hold on for a specific period or distance. The sport has been subject to controversy, particularly concerning animal welfare, as critics argue that it can cause harm and distress to the bulls involved. Legal battles have ensued, with the Supreme Court of India banning the sport in 2014 due to animal cruelty concerns. However, following widespread protests, a state law was passed in 2017 legalizing Jallikattu under certain regulations. Despite ongoing debates, the sport continues to be a significant and contested tradition, balancing cultural heritage with animal welfare considerations.
